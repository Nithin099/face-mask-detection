# face-mask-detection
Developed a real-time TensorFlow and OpenCV-Python facemask detection method. By using a CNN that has been trained on a variety of datasets, the system can reliably identify people who are or are not wearing facemasks in a range of public environments, improving compliance with COVID-19 safety regulations.
